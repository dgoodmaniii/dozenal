Instructions
============

To compile the programs, just type "make". Alternatively, programs can
be compiled individually by running "make" in their corresponding
subdirectory.

To install run "make install". To install binaries only (no docs) run
"make installbin". To install html documentation run "make installhtml".
The commands can of course be combined as "make install installhtml".

Certain paths can be adjusted at install time by setting variables on the
command line, as in:
%make prefix=/usr mandir=/usr/man htmldir=/usr/share/doc/html

Dependencies
============

Several of the programs have dependencies in order to compile and/or run.  Included are some command line instructions for installing these dependencies that could help on an Ubuntu Linux system:

dozdate
-------

Requires the ``hdate`` library::

    $ sudo apt-get install libhdate-dev

dozcal
------

Requires ``Lua`` 5.2 develompent libraries::

    $ sudo apt-get install liblua5.2-dev

gdozdc
------

Requires some Perl modules::

    $ cpan
    cpan> install Tk
    cpan> install PAR

dozdc
-----

Graphical version requires the ``xforms`` library, can manually modify the Makefile to build non-graphical version without it.

``xforms`` is available at http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/xforms/

``xforms`` in turn requires the ``xpm`` library::

    $ sudo apt-get install libxpm-dev
